* Android Table Editor
** Description
   This is a table editor. It meant to provide a draggable table where
   you edit the values.

   I use it in CSound to modify tables live and use wave guide like instruments

** Current Issues
   - Borders 
     - we need to be able to set 0
** Todo
*** Integrate old modifier algorithms
    - Could use a long click or could provide buttons on either side
      - would solve the border issue
    - Would be nice if we could see a list of options with checkboxes
      for those processes rather than onetime shots
*** Settings menu
    - Would be nice to press the menu button to set things
    - setting include 
      - host
      - port
      - id
*** Settings per unit
    - Min and Max
    - Table ID
    - Log scale
*** License
    - GPL3 it so everyone hates it
*** Put on github
    - Need a license first
*** Video demo
    - need to show a video of us using it
